Dashboards are designed to convey insights, facilitate data exploration, and allow users to interact with the visualizations. 

The dataset from kaggle, that had been meticulously cleaned and preprocessed had been rendered ready for analysis and an additional layer to improve the analysis efficiency routed to perform data sampling as the data consisted substantial null values and had no initial positive effect on the data, later this finalized data was imported into Tableau. There, its improved and organized form was used to generate interactive dashboards, reports, and visualizations that helped answer analysis questions by identifying the correlations, patterns, and trends in the data and aid in making well-informed decisions.
